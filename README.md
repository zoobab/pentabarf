FOSDEM runs a ~~severely~~ somewhat mangled version of Pentabarf.  Over
the years, we have pulled in many patches from many places and grown a
lot of our own changes.  Most of this happened under the influence of
various mind-expanding substances and without any meaningful revision
control.

The purpose of this GitHub project is to try to merge our changes with
others' and maybe to become a source of truth for other conferences.

Branches
--------
* _master_: reflects (or should reflect) what's currently running on
  https://penta.fosdem.org/, modulo configuration bits.  This branch is
  the result of a manual merge of the original upstream and the evil
  hackery in the _historical_ branch.

* _historical_: the code that ran on https://penta.fosdem.org/ until
  approximately January 2014.  Preserved on GitHub for posterity, or as
  a warning to others, or in the interest of historical accuracy.  Pick
  the reason you like best.
